Instructors
------------

* `Jesse Bloom <http://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html>`_ (lead instructor; jbloom[at]fredhutch.org)

* `Max Libbrecht <http://noble.gs.washington.edu/~maxwl/home.html>`_ (maxwl[at]cs.washington.edu)

* Yi Yin (yy224[at]uw.edu)

* Adrian Verster (averster[at]uw.edu)

* `Frank DiMaio <http://www.ipd.uw.edu/people/ipd-faculty-staff/frank-dimaio/>`_ (dimaio[at]uw.edu)

Meeting times and locations
----------------------------
Tuesday and Thursday, 10:30 to 11:50 AM, `Foege Building S110 <http://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/gnom>`_.

Prerequisites
---------------
`GENOME 540 <http://bozeman.mbt.washington.edu/compbio/mbt599/>`_ or permission of instructor.

Students must be able to write computer programs for data analysis. Some prior exposure to probability, statistics and molecular biology is highly desirable.

Course materials
----------------
No textbook is required for this class.

Course requirements
----------------------
* The entire course grade is based on the homework assignments.

* The homeworks involve writing programs for data analysis, and running them on a computer that you have access to (we cannot provide computers). We don't require a specific language.

* Unless otherwise specified, homeworks are assigned on Thursday and due before class the following Thursday.

* Late homework will be penalized. Specifically, each assignment is worth 100 points, from which 10 points will be deducted for each day (or fraction thereof) that you turn it in late. The maximum deduction for being late is 60 points.

* It is OK to run your program on someone else's input data file, and compare outputs to see if you get the same results. However, it is not OK to share programs or to get someone else to debug your program. A key part of the course is being able to write and debug your own program.

* Homework assignments should be turned in using the Catalyst Tools Dropbox.

Examinations
---------------
None.

Course grade
--------------
10% for each homework
